# Overview

libsignal-client is an implementation of the Signal client protocol in Rust.

Work in progress.  Subject to change without notice, use outside Signal not yet recommended.

# Building

To build anything in this repository you must have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed.
The build currently uses a specific version of the Rust nightly compiler, which
will be downloaded automatically by cargo. To build and test the basic protocol
libraries:

```shell
$ cargo build
...
$ cargo test
...
```

## Java/Android

To build for Android you must install several additional packages including a JDK,
the Android NDK/SDK, and add the Android targets to the Rust compiler, using

```rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android```

as well as the Cargo NDK tool using

```cargo install --version=1.0.0 cargo-ndk```

To build the Java/Android ``jar`` and ``aar``, and run the tests:

```shell
$ cd java
$ ./gradlew test
```

Alternately, a build system using Docker is available:

```shell
$ cd java
$ make java_test
```

## Swift

To learn about the Swift build process see [``swift/README.md``](swift/)
